# How I Reveal the Opening Date of Capital Club?

## Official Statement

First of all, I DO NOT and I will NOT want to harm Luke Belmar by writing this thing. 
Second one. I DID NOT, I DO NOT and I will NOT reveal the date of Opening Capital Club to anybody signed up to Capital Club Waitlist.

Luke Belmar is one my biggest authorities in my life. 

His speeches, datesets and videos literally changed my perspective about life. Period.

And once again, my case study of doing this are not about harming or acting to the detriment of Capital Club.

The purpose of doing that is to show you guys how EASILY valueable information can be access and how to avoid this in REAL LIFE.

## Preparation

I hop into Virtual MAchine.

I change my IP address with ProtonVPN.

I created Private Browser Instance for cleaning my cookies and history.

## Research

## How to AVOID this type of thing

As we gone more deep we can see that Content Management System of Capital Club is Wordpress

https://builtwith.com/CAPITAL.CLUB

1) Security Plugin

I did not found any Security Plugin like Wordfence, All in One Wordpress Security etc.

The very first is to install security plugin to avoid the most basic and the most simple to execute attacks on Wordpress.

2) Set content Private

Just go to sites, go to settings and change read permission to private or password protected or even Unpublished.

3) Whitelisting IP of Leaders/Developers

While site is in time of building very often developers leave content and sites without any protection and focusing on creating backend and system managing.
Without IP whitelisting ANYONE can access resources BEFORE the site would be already launched. 

Set the Firewall Rules in the Security Plugin like Wordfence and your content is properly prohibited and SECURED.
